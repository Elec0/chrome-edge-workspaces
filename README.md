This is a Chrome copy of the Microsoft Edge Workspaces feature. It allows you to save a set of tabs as a workspace and open them later.
The different thing about this particular tab manager is it will automatically save every time you close a tab or a window.

For other tab managers, I hate having to remember to save the open tabs. I should be able to just close the window and they should save to the window's workspace. 
So that's what this extension does.

* When a workspace is opened, store the window ID matched to the workspace name
* When it's closed, use the window ID to get the workspace and save the tabs to it
